# About this Project
**Customer Life Time Value (CLV):** The value that customers bring during their time of operation.
Determine which customers are worth investing in and exploiting.
Businesses need to calculate the CLV index to determine which customer groups bring high value.

=> Provide appropriate marketing strategies to optimize profits and costs.
This Notebook show the way to determine which customer groups bring value (high CLV) and provide techniques to identify and group CLV, select appropriate machine learning models to classify high-CLV groups.


## Prerequisites
